# Glitch-HCCS
This is my attempt to learn to script an HCCS run as [Glitch (#1885144)](https://api.aventuristo.net/av-snapshot?u=Glitch)

It started in ASH, but will be slowly shifting into JavaScript/TypeScript whenever I have spare time to sit down and learn.


## License
TBD

## Installation
Run this command in the graphical CLI:
```
git checkout https://github.com/GlitchScripts/Glitch-HCCS main
```
It will require a [recent build of KoLMafia](https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia/releases).
