# Glitch-HCCS
I am Glitch (#1885144)

This is my attempt to learn to script an HCCS run

It started in ASH, but will be slowly shifting into JavaScript/TypeScript when I have time to learn


## License
TBD

## Installation
Run this command in the graphical CLI:
```
git checkout https://github.com/GlitchScripts/Glitch-HCCS main
```
This will require [a recent build of KoLMafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/lastSuccessfulBuild/)
