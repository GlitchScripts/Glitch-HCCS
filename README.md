# Glitch-HCCS
This is my attempt to learn basic scripting in KoL. It started in ASH, but will slowly be shifting into JavaScript/TypeScript whenever I have spare time to sit down and practice.


## Required IoTMs:
Will add a comprehensive list later, but just assume that you need a strict match to what I currently have:

[Glitch (#1885144)](https://api.aventuristo.net/av-snapshot?u=Glitch)

## Required HC-Permed Skills:
So many...will list them soon.

## Other requirements:
Your locket should have the following monsters in it:

Ungulith for a corrupted marrow

Witchess Bishop for a Sacramento wine (size 1 EPIC booze that gives +50% item drops)

Black Crayon Pirate for a free fight that leaves the Locket with a +50% booze drop buff

## Ascension Details:
No astral pet required
Astral six-pack recommended
Sauceror
Wallaby (for friendly Degrassi Knoll to get cheap desert access, then tune the moon to Blender for Gno-Mart candies)

// more details to be added later

## Installation
Run this command in the graphical CLI:
```
git checkout https://github.com/GlitchScripts/Glitch-HCCS main
```
It will require a [recent build of KoLMafia](https://github.com/kolmafia/kolmafia/releases).
